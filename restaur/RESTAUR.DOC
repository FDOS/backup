               Free Software by TapirSoft Gisbert W.Selke



RESTAUR is a more versatile replacement for DOS RESTORE. It handles old
backups made by DOS versions 3.2 or earlier as well as those made by
current DOS releases (up to 4.01 as of this writing). It allows
restoration of files to the original directories, as offered by DOS
BACKUP; in addition, files may be restored to different locations or
under different names.

RESTAUR is also more forgiving with respect to the disk sequence: a
restauration may begin in the middle of a series of disks (but not in
the middle of a single file!).

Start RESTAUR stating the source path and the destination path, in
this order; e.g.,

                RESTAUR  a:  c:

to restore from backup disks in drive A: to hard disk C:, preserving the
original locations of files within subdirectories.

Alternatively, the destination may consist not only of a drive, but of a
complete path; in this case, the original locations of files are
discarded and replaced by the specified one; e.g.,

                RESTAUR  a:  c:\test

to restore everything in directory TEST of drive C:.

All the backed-up files are offered one by one for

             C  - copying (i.e., restoration),
             R  - renaming,
             D  - change of destination on a single file basis,
             A  - proceeding without asking more questions,
             S  - skipping a single file,
             Q  - quitting the restoration.

If a file is found to already exist in the destination directory, the
user is prompted again for

             O  - overwriting,
             R  - renaming,
             D  - change of destination,
             S  - skipping this file.

There are two optional command line arguments:

/A copies all files without asking questions out of class 1 above, just
as if A had been answered on the very first file.

/O overwrites all existing files without ado; in other words, class 2
questions are never asked.

Both /A and /O together provide fully automatic service.

Brief on-line help is available by giving a command line argument of ?.



This is free software; it may be used and copied freely but must not be
sold for profit under any circumstances.


Acknowledgments:

I have used information on the various DOS backup formats published in
the February 89 issue of c't. I have used none of their code, however.

The Wissenschaftliches Institut der Ortskrankenkassen, Bonn, has kindly
supplied me with test data.

The code was developped and compiled using Borland's TurboPascal 6.0
compiler.
